- Choose tennis courts among the registered courts in the location
- Check their account information
- Assign available time slot
- Define their skill level - novice/intermediate/advanced
- Declare their status - looking for a tennis mate (y/n)
- Choose tennis courts among the registered courts in vancouver in the system

This application will provide a user information in the chosen courts:
- Find all assigned players
- Find players who are available in selected timeslot
- Find players who are looking for a tennis mate
- Assigned coaches

This application aims to minimize the effort to find a right match based on usersâ€™ availability, level and a court.

##Phase 4: Task 2
- Bi-directional association between Court and User. Court class calls addUser method and removeUsers method to maintain its user list, and User class calls addPreferredCourt method and removePreferredCourt method to maintain the corresponding court (assigned court).


##Phase 4: Task 3
- UML diagram added : UML_Design_Diagram.pdf
- Coupling in TennisMateApp and TennisMateAppGUI : there are some methods used in both classes. 
    - generate super class, and have TennisMateApp and TennisMateGUI as subclass would minimize the duplication and coupling issue
    - ex) shared method: init(), loadCourt(), login(), loadData(), saveData()
- Cohesion in TennisMateApp and TennisMateAppGUI :  
    - court specific and user specific method can be implemented to Court class and User class. ex) getCourts to getCourtsByName method in Court.
- Readability : TennisMateApp and TennisMateGUI have conditional statements and iterations upon user's input which possibly cause readability issue. New method can be extracted from the codes.  
- Reduction of duplication : There are duplicated code used in some methods in TennisMateApp and TennisMateGUI, especially for print statements. 
    - The duplicated part can be extracted as a method to reduce the duplication.
    - create Map<userName, User> would reduce redundant code implementation and redundant iterations when searching user's info. 
- Updated: 
    - generated printErrMsg method to reduce the duplicated code when print error message and error icon in TennisMateAppGUI
    - extracted methods to improve readability in TennisMateApp. ex) findUserFromUserList(), generateSortedUserListInSelectedTimeSlot() 
    - move getCourtsByName in TennisGUI to Court to improve cohesion
